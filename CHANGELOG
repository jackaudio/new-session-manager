nsmd now follows the XDG Base Directory Specifications:
 Default session directory moved from ~/NSM Sessions/ to $XDG_DATA_HOME/nsm/ (see issue #gh-15)
 The old path ~/NSM Sessions/ is still supported and has priority, for now. This may be switched off in the future.
 Lockfiles fixed (see issue #gh-31)
 Lockfiles are now in $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nsm/
 Lockfiles now each contain the session path, the osc NSM_URL and the nsmd PID
 New section in the API documentation for the above.
Fixes and guards against trying to load non-existing sessions and creating new sessions under existing names

WARNING: Next scheduled release (2021-04-15) will switch the default session root
to $XDG_DATA_HOME ( default on most distributions: ~/.local/share/nsm/ )
With the next release prepare to do one of the following:
*  Move old sessions to the new root directory (preferred)
*  Symlink "~/NSM Sessions" to the new root directory
*  use the nsmd --session-root commandline argument.

 Extras are technically not connected to the main programs of this repository.
 There is no dependency to any "extra" nor any license implications.
 Please read extras/README.md.

 Repair nsmd to correctly send client data when running headless and a GUI announces later.
 ClientId generation now prevent collision with existing IDs.
 nsmd command line option --load-session to directly load one (Berkelder, Rik)
 Better detection of clients that failed to launch leads to faster session startup (by 5 seconds)
 Users get informed by client-label if an executable is not present on the system or permission denied
 Fixed reply for listing sessions from a plain "Done." to proper reply path with empty string as terminal symbol  "/reply", "/nsm/server/list", ""
 Fix operation reply to last treated client instead to reply to sender (Picot, Mathieu  / houston)
 /nsm/gui/session/name send consistent session name/relative-path pair to the annouced GUI, no matter how the session was loaded.
